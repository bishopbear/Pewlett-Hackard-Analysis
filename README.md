# DB creation and analysis with SQL

Overview

  The purpose of this project is to help our client prepare for turnover in their workforce. Our client was still using Excel/VBA to keep track of their employee data. Before we began analysis, we developed an ERD so that we could create an organized and efficient database for our client. We used Postgres to create the database and PgAdmin for our analysis. Our final product was a database that they could use moving forward as well as providing them estimates on how many current employees are set to retire as well as where to look in their current workforce for employees to help train new staff.
  
Results

  Here is a list of staff we have identified as retiring soon:
  * 29414 Senior Engineer
  * 28254 Senior Staff
  * 14222 Engineer
  * 4502 Technique Leader
  * 1761 Assistant Manager
  * 2 Manager
  _________
  78155 Total Employees Identified.
  
  - This represents about 25% of current workforce
  - Almost 20% of retiring staff are listed as Senior
  - Most of the retiring staff are in either senior leadership or specialized engineering roles
  - Because of the large amount that are retiring we are hopeful that we can retain enough of them to participate in the Mentorship Program

Summary
North of 78k roles will need to be filled. While this is in itself a high number, we are anticipating that our client may need to move that number higher due to possible company growth and that finding good talent is not always easy. Also, a large amount of specialized staff (engineers) and leadership talent (senior staff) will need to be replaced. This will likely effect every area of the company and because of this our client needs to be thoughtful in how they approach these employees so that they will be more eager to mentor new staff.

Yes. There are enough employees to mentor the next generation. Since it is likely that one mentor can help out more than one new employee there should be enough to fill out this program.
