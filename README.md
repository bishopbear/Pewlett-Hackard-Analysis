# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Overview
  The purpose of this analysis is to help Pewlett Hackard Senior Management prepare for turnover in their workforce. We have provided them an estimate on how many current employees are set to retire as well as where to look in their current workforce for employees to help train new staff.
  
Results
  Here is a list of staff we have identified as retiring soon:
  29414 Senior Engineer
  28254 Senior Staff
  14222 Engineer
  4502 Technique Leader
  1761 Assistant Manager
  2 Manager
  _________
  78155 Total Employees Identified.
  
  - This represents about 25% of Pewlett Hackards current workforce
  - Almost 20% of retiring staff are listed as Senior
  - Most of the retiring staff are in either senior leadership or specialized engineering roles
  - Because of the large amount that are retiring we are hopeful that PH can retain enough of them to participate in the Mentorship Program

Summary
North of 78k roles will need to be filled. While this is in itself a high number, we are anticipating that PH move that number higher due to possible company growth and that finding good talent is not always easy. At some point, PH is set to lose a large amount of specialized staff (engineers) and leadership talent (senior staff). This will likely effect every area of the company and because of this PH needs to be thoughtful in how they approach these employees so that they will be more eager to mentor new staff.

Yes. There are enough employees to mentor the next generation. Since it is likely that one mentor can help out more than one new employee there should be enough to fill out this program.
